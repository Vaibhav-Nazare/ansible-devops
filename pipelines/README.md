# IBM Maximo Application Suite Tekton Pipelines

These pipelines are all powered by the container image in this same repository, and provide an alternative to running our Ansible roles and playbooks locally.  With Pipelines you can configure your own devops processes directly in the cluster and chain togther the building blocks (ClusterTasks) that we have created.

To learn more about Tekton refer to the excellent material here: https://redhat-scholars.github.io/tekton-tutorial/tekton-tutorial/index.html

This aspect of the project is still in active development and should be considered pre-release.  However, we are using these extensively in our own development, so they should be pretty reliable given we use them multiple times every day in our automation frameworks.

### Usage
All commands assume you are in the root directory where you have cloned this repository.

### 1. Provision Cluster and Install OpenShift Pipelines Operator
After provisioning and logging into the cluster, you can use the install script provided: `bin/install-pipelines.sh`:

```bash
export IBMCLOUD_APIKEY=xxx
export CLUSTER_NAME=xxx
ansible-playbook ibm/mas_devops/playbooks/ocp/provision-roks.yml && ansible-playbook ibm/mas_devops/playbooks/cp4d/hack-worker-nodes.yml
pipelines/bin/install-pipelines.sh
```


# 2. Build and Install the MAS Pipeline Task Definitions
```
export DEV_MODE=true
export VERSION=7.0.0

pipelines/bin/build-pipelines.sh
oc apply -f pipelines/ibm-mas_devops-clustertasks-$VERSION.yaml
```

# 3. Install and run the MAS Sample Pipeline
Modify the [sample-pipelinesettings.yaml](samples/sample-pipelinesettings.yaml) to populate it with your own settings before applying it to the cluster, and optionally customize the parameters in [sample-pipelinerun-mas86.yaml](samples/sample-pipelinerun-mas86.yaml) if you wish to adjust the subscription channels for the MAS applications.

```bash
oc new-project mas-sample-pipelines
oc apply -f pipelines/samples/sample-pipelinesettings.yaml

oc create secret generic pipeline-additional-configs \
  --from-file=/home/david/masconfig/workspace_masdev.yaml

oc create secret generic pipeline-sls-entitlement \
  --from-file=/home/david/masconfig/entitlement.lic

oc apply -f pipelines/samples/sample-pipeline.yaml
oc create -f pipelines/samples/sample-pipelinerun-mas86.yaml
```
