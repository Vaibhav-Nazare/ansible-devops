# MAS Devops Ansible Collection

## Requirements

### Python & Ansible
[Python 3.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/) is recommended as it is the most widely used version of Python within our development team, but any in-support 3.x version of Python should work fine:

The following python modules are required in order to use this collection.

- **openshift**
- **ansible**

!!! important
    As of version 6 of this collection the dependencies have changed. The upgrade from `community.kubernetes` to `kubernetes.core` necessitates an upgrade in the version of the kubernetes and openshift modules from v11 to v12.


#### Useful commands
- Confirm availability and version: `python3 --version`
- Installed Python modules: `python3 -m pip install ansible junit_xml pymongo xmljson kubernetes==12.0.1 openshift==0.12.1`
- Confirm that ansible has been correctly installed: `ansible-playbook --version`


### IBM Cloud CLI
If you are using this collection to manage an OpenShift cluster in IBM Cloud RedHat OpenShift Kubernetes Service (ROKS), then you must install the IBM Cloud CLI:

#### Useful commands
- Install: `curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM-Cloud/ibm-cloud-developer-tools/master/linux-installer/idt-installer | bash`
- Confirm availability and version: `ibmcloud version`

### OpenShift CLI
If you do not already have the `oc` command line tool, you can download it as below:

```
wget -q https://github.com/openshift/origin/releases/download/v3.11.0/openshift-origin-client-tools-v3.11.0-0cbc58b-linux-64bit.tar.gz
tar -xvzf openshift-origin-client-tools-v3.11.0-0cbc58b-linux-64bit.tar.gz
mv openshift-origin-client-tools-v3.11.0-0cbc58b-linux-64bit/oc /usr/local/bin/
rm -rf openshift-origin-client-tools-v3.11.0-0cbc58b-linux-64bit openshift-origin-client-tools-v3.11.0-0cbc58b-linux-64bit.tar.gz
```

#### Useful commands
- Confirm availability and version: `oc version`
