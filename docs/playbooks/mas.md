# MAS Playbooks

## Install MAS
Before you use this playbook you will likely want to edit the `mas_config` variable to supply your own configurtation, instead of the sample data provided.


### Required environment variables
- `MAS_INSTANCE_ID` Declare the instance ID for the MAS install
- `MAS_ENTITLEMENT_KEY` Provide your IBM entitlement key
- `MAS_CONFIG_DIR` Directory where generated config files will be saved (you may also provide pre-generated config files here)

### Optional environment variables
- `MAS_CATALOG_SOURCE` Set to `ibm-mas-operators` if you want to deploy pre-release development builds
- `MAS_CHANNEL` Override the default release channel (8.x)
- `MAS_DOMAIN` Override the default generated domain for the MAS installation
- `MAS_ICR_CP` Override the registry source for all container images deployed by the MAS operator
- `MAS_ICR_CPOPEN` Override the registry source for all container images deployed by the MAS operator
- `MAS_ENTITLEMENT_USERNAME` Override the default entitlement username (cp)
- `MAS_UPGRADE_STRATEGY` Override the use of Manual upgrade strategy.

!!! note
   

### Example usage: release build

```bash
export MAS_INSTANCE_ID=xxx
export MAS_ENTITLEMENT_KEY=xxx

ansible-playbook playbooks/mas/install-suite.yml
```

!!! note
    Lookup your entitlement key from the [IBM Container Library](https://myibm.ibm.com/products-services/containerlibrary)


### Example usage: pre-release build

```bash
export MAS_CATALOG_SOURCE=ibm-mas-operators
export MAS_CHANNEL=8.5.0-pre.m2dev85
export MAS_INSTANCE_ID=xxx

export MAS_ICR_CP=wiotp-docker-local.artifactory.swg-devops.com
export MAS_ICR_CPOPEN=wiotp-docker-local.artifactory.swg-devops.com
export MAS_ENTITLEMENT_USERNAME=$W3_USERNAME_LOWERCASE
export MAS_ENTITLEMENT_KEY=$ARTIFACTORY_APIKEY

export MAS_CONFIG_DIR=~/masconfig

ansible-playbook playbooks/mas/install-suite.yml
```

!!! important
    You must have already installed the development (pre-release) catalogs, pre-release builds are not available directly from the IBM Operator Catalog.


## Cloud Internet Services integration
This optional feature allows you to integrate MAS with an existing instance of [IBM Cloud Internet Services](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/cloud-internet-services) (CIS) to provide automatic DNS management and certificates signed by LetsEncrypt.

To utilise this feature you must set the optional `MAS_DOMAIN` detailed previously, and define additional CIS-specific environment variables as follows.

### Required environment variables
- `CIS_CRN` which can be obtained from your CIS service overview page, it will be in the format: `crn:v1:bluemix:public:internet-svcs:global:a/02fd888448c1415baa2bcd65684e4db3:9969652f-6955-482b-b59c-asdasasdede50c::`
- `CIS_APIKEY` A Service ID API key with DNS API Editor/Manager access.  Note: (This API key will be stored in your cluster for DNS challenge when requesting new certs)

Process to create a strict api key that can only access the `Internet Services` service:
- Create a Service ID
- Create an "Access Policy" with the following entries:
  - `Scope of access` set to `Resources based on selected attributes`
  - `Platform access` set to `Editor`
  - `Service access` set to `Manager`
- Create an API KEY for the Service ID, which is the CIS_APIKEY
 
Information on [Service IDs](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-serviceids&interface=ui)

### Optional environment variables
- `CIS_SUBDOMAIN` Subdomain used by your DNS server. It allow you to reuse CIS for multiple MAS Instances.
- `CIS_SKIP_DNS_ENTRIES` Skips DNS entries creation if you are have them
- `CIS_SKIP_CLUSTER_ISSUER` Skips Cluster Issuer CR creation and CIS webhook installation if you already have it
- `UPDATE_DNS_ENTRIES` Whether to replace DNS entries already created
- `OCP_INGRESS` Default to your cluster OCP ingress. This value is used as the target for the DNS entries

### Example
This example will configure MAS to run under the domain **mas.internal.mydomain.com** with all DNS entries for MAS managed by a CIS instance controlling **mydomain.com**.

```bash
export MAS_INSTANCE_ID=xxx
export MAS_ENTITLEMENT_KEY=xxx
export MAS_DOMAIN=mas.internal.mydomain.com

# Configure CIS integration
export IBMCLOUD_APIKEY=xxx
export CIS_SUBDOMAIN=mas.internal
export CIS_CRN=crn:v1:bluemix:public:internet-svcs:global:a/02fd888448c1415baa2bcd65684e4db3:9969652f-6955-482b-b59c-asdasasdede50c::

ansible-playbook playbooks/mas/install-suite.yml
```

## Install MAS Application
Install a MAS (Gen2) application, supported applications:

- Manage
- Health
- Predict
- MSO
- IoT
- Monitor
- Safety

!!! note
    Today, this only supports deployment of a MAS application with default settings.

### Example
```bash
export MAS_INSTANCE_ID=xxx
export MAS_WORKSPACE_ID=masdev
export MAS_APP_ID=manage

ansible-playbook playbooks/mas/configure-app.yml
```


----


## Configure MAS Application
Configure a MAS (Gen2) application in a workspace, supported applications:

- Manage (`base` only - see [Configure Manage Application](#configure-manage-application))
- Health
- Predict
- MSO
- IoT
- Monitor
- Safety

!!! note
    Today, this only supports configuring a workspace with default settings.

### Example

The following call will install Manage with latest versions of Health and Service Provider components enabled.

```bash
export MAS_INSTANCE_ID=xxx
export MAS_WORKSPACE_ID=masdev
export MAS_APP_ID=manage
export MAS_APPWS_COMPONENTS="{'base':{'version':'latest'},'health':{'version':'latest'},'serviceprovider':{'version':'latest'}}"

ansible-playbook playbooks/mas/configure-app.yml
```

----

## Manage Db2 Hack
This should should be part of the Manage operator, but is not so we have to do it as a seperate step in the install flow for now.  This will configure the Db2 database instance and create a new schema named `maximo` (the default schema name used by the Manage application) as well as SQL instructions to prepare database for Manage installation.

The parameters are all optional:

- `CPD_NAMESPACE` namespace where Cloud Pak for Data is installed. Default is `cpd_meta_namespace`
- `DB2WH_INSTANCE_NAME` name of the DB2 Warehouse instance created in CP4D.

### Examples

```bash
(...)

ansible-playbook playbooks/cp4d/install-services-db2.yml

ansible-playbook playbooks/mas/hack-manage-db2.yml
```

```bash
(...)

ansible-playbook playbooks/cp4d/create-db2-instance.yml

export CPD_DB2WH_INSTANCE_NAME=db2w-iot

ansible-playbook playbooks/mas/hack-manage-db2.yml
```
