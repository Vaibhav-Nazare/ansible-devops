# TODO: The default that is built into the manage operator isn't following
# the naming conventions for MAS.  It should have been some combination of
# {{mas_instance_id}} {{mas_app_id}} and {{mas_workspace_id}} so that it's
# friendly to shared database sources in low cost environments, and easily
# templateable in automation such as this :(
